# intercom-ruby

Ruby bindings for the Intercom API (https://developers.intercom.io/reference).

[API Documentation](https://developers.intercom.io/docs)

[Gem Documentation](http://rubydoc.info/github/intercom/intercom-ruby/master/frames)

For generating Intercom javascript script tags for Rails, please see https://github.com/intercom/intercom-rails.

## Upgrading information

Version 3 of intercom-ruby is not backwards compatible with previous versions.

Version 3 moves away from a global setup approach to the use of an Intercom Client.

This version of the gem is compatible with `Ruby 2.1` and above.

## Installation

    gem install intercom

Using bundler:

    gem 'intercom', '~> 3.5.23'

## Basic Usage

### Configure your client

> If you already have a personal access token you can find it [here](https://app.intercom.io/developers/_/access-token). If you want to create or learn more about personal access tokens then you can find more info [here](https://developers.intercom.io/docs/personal-access-tokens).

```ruby
# With an OAuth or Personal Access token:
intercom = Intercom::Client.new(token: 'my_token')
```

If you are building a third party application you can get your access_tokens by [setting-up-oauth](https://developers.intercom.io/page/setting-up-oauth) for Intercom.
You can also use the [omniauth-intercom lib](https://github.com/intercom/omniauth-intercom) which is a middleware helping you to handle the authentication process with Intercom.

### Examples

#### Users

```ruby
# Find user by email
user = intercom.users.find(email: "bob@example.com")
# Find user by user_id
user = intercom.users.find(user_id: "1")
# Find user by id
user = intercom.users.find(id: "1")
# Create a user
user = intercom.users.create(email: "bob@example.com", name: "Bob Smith", signed_up_at: Time.now.to_i)
# Delete a user
user = intercom.users.find(id: "1")
deleted_user = intercom.users.delete(user)
# Update custom_attributes for a user
user.custom_attributes["average_monthly_spend"] = 1234.56
intercom.users.save(user)
# Perform incrementing
user.increment('karma')
intercom.users.save(user)
# Perform decrementing
user.decrement('karma', 5)
intercom.users.save(user)
# Iterate over all users
intercom.users.all.each {|user| puts %Q(#{user.email} - #{user.custom_attributes["average_monthly_spend"]}) }
intercom.users.all.map {|user| user.email }
# List your users create in the last two days
intercom.users.find_all(type: 'users', page: 1, per_page: 10, created_since: 2, order: :asc).to_a.each_with_index {|usr, i| puts "#{i+1}: #{usr.name}"};
# Paginate through your list of users choosing how many to return per page (default and max is 50 per page)
intercom.users.find_all(type: 'users', page: 1, per_page: 10, order: :asc).to_a.each_with_index {|usr, i| puts "#{i+1}: #{usr.name}"}
# If you have over 10,000 users then you will need to use the scroll function to list your users
# otherwise you will encounter a page limit with list all your users
# You can use the scroll method to list all your users
intercom.users.scroll.each { |user| puts user.name}
# Alternatively you can use the scroll.next method to get 100 users with each request
result = intercom.users.scroll.next
# The result object then contains a records attributes that is an array of your user objects and it also contains a scroll_param which
# you can then use to request the next 100 users. Note that the scroll parameter will time out after one minute and you will need to
# make a new request
result.scroll_param
=> "0730e341-63ef-44da-ab9c-9113f886326d"
result = intercom.users.scroll.next("0730e341-63ef-44da-ab9c-9113f886326d");

```

#### Full loading of an embedded entity
```ruby
# Given a conversation with a partial user, load the full user. This can be
# done for any entity
intercom.users.load(conversation.user)
```

#### Sending messages
```ruby

# InApp message from admin to user
intercom.messages.create({
  message_type: 'inapp',
  body: "What's up :)",
  from: {
    type: 'admin',
    id: "1234"
  },
  to: {
    type: "user",
    user_id: "5678"
  }
})

# Email message from admin to user
intercom.messages.create({
  message_type: 'email',
  subject: 'Hey there',
  body: "What's up :)",
  template: "plain", # or "personal",
  from: {
    type: "admin",
    id: "1234"
  },
  to: {
    type: "user",
    id: "536e564f316c83104c000020"
  }
})

# Message from a user
intercom.messages.create({
  from: {
    type: "user",
    id: "536e564f316c83104c000020"
  },
  body: "halp"
})

# Message from admin to contact

intercom.messages.create({
  body: "How can I help :)",
  from: {
    type: "admin",
    id: "1234"
  },
  to: {
    type: "contact",
    id: "536e5643as316c83104c400671"
  }
})

# Message from a contact
intercom.messages.create({
  from: {
    type: "contact",
    id: "536e5643as316c83104c400671"
  },
  body: "halp"
})
```

#### Events
```ruby
intercom.events.create(
  event_name: "invited-friend",
  created_at: Time.now.to_i,
  email: user.email,
  metadata: {
    "invitee_email" => "pi@example.org",
    invite_code: "ADDAFRIEND",
    "found_date" => 12909364407
  }
)

# Retrieve event list for user with id:'123abc'
 intercom.events.find_all("type" => "user", "intercom_user_id" => "123abc")

```

Metadata Objects support a few simple types that Intercom can present on your behalf

```ruby
intercom.events.create(
  event_name: "placed-order",
  email: current_user.email,
  created_at: 1403001013,
  metadata: {
    order_date: Time.now.to_i,
    stripe_invoice: 'inv_3434343434',
    order_number: {
      value: '3434-3434',
      url: 'https://example.org/orders/3434-3434'
    },
    price: {
      currency: 'usd',
      amount: 2999
    }
  }
)
```

The metadata key values in the example are treated as follows-
- order_date: a Date (key ends with '_date')
- stripe_invoice: The identifier of the Stripe invoice (has a 'stripe_invoice' key)
- order_number: a Rich Link (value contains 'url' and 'value' keys)
- price: An Amount in US Dollars (value contains 'amount' and 'currency' keys)

*NB:* This version of the gem reserves the field name `type` in Event data.

### Contacts

`Contacts` represent logged out users of your application.

```ruby
# Create a contact
contact = intercom.contacts.create(email: "some_contact@example.com")

# Update a contact
contact.custom_attributes['foo'] = 'bar'
intercom.contacts.save(contact)

# Find contacts by email
contacts = intercom.contacts.find_all(email: "some_contact@example.com")

# Convert a contact into a user
intercom.contacts.convert(contact, user)

# Delete a contact
intercom.contacts.delete(contact)

# Get a large list of contacts using scroll
intercom.contacts.scroll.each { |lead| puts lead.id}
# Please see users scroll for more details of how to use scroll
```

### Counts

```ruby
# App-wide counts
intercom.counts.for_app

# Users in segment counts
intercom.counts.for_type(type: 'user', count: 'segment')
```

### Subscriptions

Subscribe to events in Intercom to receive webhooks.

```ruby
# create a subscription
intercom.subscriptions.create(url: "http://example.com", topics: ["user.created"])

# fetch a subscription
intercom.subscriptions.find(id: "nsub_123456789")

# delete a subscription
subscription = intercom.subscriptions.find(id: "nsub_123456789")
intercom.subscriptions.delete(subscription)

# list subscriptions
intercom.subscriptions.all
```

### Errors

There are different styles for error handling - some people prefer exceptions; some prefer nil and check; some prefer error objects/codes. Balancing these preferences alongside our wish to provide an idiomatic gem has brought us to use the current mechanism of throwing specific exceptions. Our approach in the client is to propagate errors and signal our failure loudly so that erroneous data does not get propagated through our customers' systems - in other words, if you see a `Intercom::ServiceUnavailableError` you know where the problem is.

You do not need to deal with the HTTP response from an API call directly. If there is an unsuccessful response then an error that is a subclass of `Intercom::IntercomError` will be raised. If desired, you can get at the http_code of an `Intercom::IntercomError` via its `http_code` method.

The list of different error subclasses are listed below. As they all inherit off Intercom::IntercomError you can choose to rescue Intercom::IntercomError or else rescue the more specific error subclass.

```ruby
Intercom::AuthenticationError
Intercom::ServerError
Intercom::ServiceUnavailableError
Intercom::ServiceConnectionError
Intercom::ResourceNotFound
Intercom::BlockedUserError
Intercom::BadRequestError
Intercom::RateLimitExceeded
Intercom::AttributeNotSetError # Raised when you try to call a getter that does not exist on an object
Intercom::MultipleMatchingUsersError
Intercom::HttpError # Raised when response object is unexpectedly nil
```

### Rate Limiting

Calling your client's `rate_limit_details` returns a Hash that contains details about your app's current rate limit.

```ruby
intercom.rate_limit_details
#=> {:limit=>180, :remaining=>179, :reset_at=>2014-10-07 14:58:00 +0100}
```

You can handle the rate limits yourself but a simple option is to use the handle_rate_limit flag.
This will automatically catch the 429 rate limit exceeded error and wait until the reset time to retry.

```
intercom = Intercom::Client.new(token: ENV['AT'], handle_rate_limit: true)
```
